## [22.12.17]
Since its inception, SPA handle accounts located in selected organizational units. This setup enables efficient automation of large number of accounts. With this version, SPA can also manage selected accounts, irrespectively of their location in organizational units.

What can you do with SPA?
- set a pace for maintenance windows - daily, weekly, monthly, or other cron-based expression
- tag or re-tag accounts on every maintenance window
- purge cloud resources depending on their tags or on their age - or make it optional
- set or change billing alerts for each account
- consolidate billing alerts to a single Microsoft Teams channel, or to central email addresses
- adapt to your specific needs the purge script and the preparation script

We start to document changes after the solution has been used in production at Reply for 6 months. In addition, we got feedback from external enterprises for past 3 months, and integrated most suggestions into the solution.
