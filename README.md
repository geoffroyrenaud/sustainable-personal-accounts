# Recycled Temporary Accounts

With this project we promote the idea that each AWS practitioner should have his/her own account, so as to practice almost freely on the platform and accelerate innovation. At the same time, in corporate environment there is a need for managed costs and for forcing towards software automation. For this reason, accounts are purged at regular intervals, and recycled.
