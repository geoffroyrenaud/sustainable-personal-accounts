## __Sustainable Personal Accounts__

:sparkles: Liberate Software Engineers! :sparkles:
Each of them deserves a full AWS account to innovate fastly.

## :sparkles: Sustainable Personal Accounts

__What?__ SPA provides an entire AWS account to software engineers of an enterprise. Yes, this can mean thousands of AWS accounts to manage.

__Why?__ Collective business agility relies on individuals. Democratize access to AWS console and tools to accelerate innovation.

__How?__ SPA automates the management of AWS personal accounts at scale, with maintenance windows on each account. Central teams can purge resources, enforce corporate guardrails and update shared blueprints periodically and automatically.

---

## :telescope: Use Sustainable Personal Accounts to:

- align newly created AWS account with corporate policies
- configure AWS Budgets, and consolidate budget alerts
- continuously deploy the DevOps and SIEM tools of your enterprise
- force the purge of cloud resources at regular points in time
- tag AWS accounts as per FinOps and CloudOps changing needs
- manage AWS accounts collectively (by Organization Unit) or individually
- set maintenance window of your choice
- adjust CodeBuild scripts to your exact needs

---
## :rainbow: Guiding Principles

<!--
What is making this project different?

Let us explain the mental models that explain our terms of reference, and related Key Performance Indicators.
-->

__We drive innovation with experimentations__ - How many AWS accounts are for individuals across your organization? #KPI

__We trust our employees and colleagues__ - Few cloud accounts go above budget and need corrective action. #KPI

__We influence corporate culture with recycling__ - Maintenance windows enforce resource deletion (cost avoidance) and foster Continuous Integration (CI) at enterprise scale.

__We scale with automated guardrails and with insourced blueprints__

---
## :factory: Event-driven Architecture

* __Account tags store states of the machine__ and enforce scoped limitations with Service Control Policies (SCP).

* __Single event bus__ for state transitions and for events generated by SPA itself. EventBridge bus lives in Automation account.

* __Serverless processing of transitions with Lambda functions__ deployed in Automation account, and triggered with EventBridge.

* __Serverless heavy processing with CodeBuild projects__ executed within each personal account, on maintenance windows.

<!--
Heavy processing include: the update of guardrails, the update of corporate blueprints, and the purge of cloud resources.
