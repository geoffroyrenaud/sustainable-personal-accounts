## **Sustainable Personal Accounts**

:sparkles: Liberate AWS practitioners! :sparkles:
Each of them deserves a full AWS account to innovate.

## **Sustainable Personal Accounts**

__What?__ Provide an entire AWS account to every cloud practitioner of your enterprise. Yes, this can mean 1,000s of AWS accounts.

__Why?__ Because collective business agility depends on capability to build on cloud infrastructure. Access to AWS console, SDK and API is differentiating your business.

__How?__ Automate the management of AWS personal accounts at scale, including maintenance window to purge resources, to enforce corporate guardrails and to update shared blueprints. This is an open source package to be deployed within AWS Control Tower.

## **Guiding Principles**

<!--
What is making this project different?

Let us explain the mental models that explain our terms of reference, and related Key Performance Indicators.
-->

**We drive innovation by experimentations** - A KPI is the number of AWS accounts assigned to individuals across the corporation.

**We trust our employees and colleagues** - A KPI is the fraction of cloud accounts that go above budget and need corrective action.

**We influence corporate culture with recycling** - Maintenance windows enforce resource deletion (cost avoidance) and foster Continuous Integration (CI) at enterprise scale.

**We scale with automated guardrails and with insourced blueprints**

# **State Machine**

__Vanilla Accounts__ have just been created

<!--
The recommended way to create accounts is to leverage the factory that is created by AWS Control Tower in AWS Service Catalog.
You can also integrate an existing AWS account into the system, however, this is adding a lot of manual work and should be avoided.
In the end, you get vanilla accounts that can be checked and validated before they are moved to the next state.
-->

__Assigned Accounts__ need guardrails and blueprints

__Released Accounts__ are available to individuals

__Expired Accounts__ need purge of resources

---
## **Event-driven Architecture**

* __Organisational Units (OU) store states of the machine__ and enforce scoped limitations with Service Control Policies (SCP).

* __Single event bus__ for OU transitions and for events generated by SPA itself. EventBridge bus lives in Automation account.

* __Serverless processing of transitions with Lambda functions__ deployed in Automation account, and triggered with EventBridge.

* __Serverless heavy processing with CodeBuild projects__ executed within each personal account, on maintenance windows.

<!--
Heavy processing include: the update of guardrails, the update of corporate blueprints, and the purge of cloud resources.

## <!--fit--> **How to adapt the solution to your specific requirements?**

* __Serverless customization with SSM Parameter Store:__ Add script shell commands of your choice to CodeBuild projects.

* __Fork this open source project:__ If you have python competencies with AWS CDK and boto3, then feel free to fork this project and to taylor it to your specific needs.

* __Reply can help!__ We are using the system for ourselves. And we have developed it, before sharing it with the community. [![Contact Reply](https://d11wkw82a69pyn.cloudfront.net/siteassets/images/logos/companies/reply-corporate-logo.png)](https://www.reply.com/)
