# [\#85 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/85) `closed`: exclude credits and refunds from cost reports

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-04-07 19:36](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/85):

## What is this?
Today SPA does not filter unblended costs. This is meaning that SPA may depart from actual usage costs due to credits and to refunds. 

## Why is this important?
With this change we remove credits and refunds from cost reports, meaning cost estimations that better represent actual usage of the platform. For example, unusual consumption cannot be masked anymore by specific credits or by some refund.

## How to implement it?
- [x] remove some records with a filter expression that is reproduced below

```
Filter={
        "Not":
        {
            'Dimensions':{
            'Key': 'RECORD_TYPE',
            'Values':['Credit','Refund']
             }
        }
    },
```

Real costs are actually important for the daily cost metrics per cost centres. However, for monthly reports we are keeping credits and refund, so that amounts displayed in Cost Explorer stay consistent with our reports.

Since linked accounts can not see some credits shown at billing account level, we should exclude them from reports produced for cost centers. Credits should be preserved for reports at organizational levels. With that change we will produce reports per cost centers that can be transmitted safely to leaders of these cost centers.

After running the reports, we checked that amounts displayed in reports for cost centers do reflect what is seen in Cost Explorer in these accounts.
