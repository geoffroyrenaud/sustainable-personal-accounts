# [\#9 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/9) `closed`: Create a rule to capture events generated by AWS Organizations and use CloudWatch log group as a target. After authentication to Automation account, go to Ireland region and create an EventBridge rule. Name it `spa-capture-aws-organizations-events`. Select event types generated by AWS Organizations, and select the CloudWatch log group created previously as a target for the rule.

The eventbridge rule need to be created in master account us-east-1. For tests purposes I have this workflow:
[ Master - EventBridge - us-east-1 ] -> [ Automation - EventBridge - eu-west-1 ] -> [ Automation - CloudwatchLog - eu-west-1 ]
