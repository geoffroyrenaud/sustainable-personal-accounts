**Labels**: `good first issue`

## What is this?
SPA computes cost metrics every day and for every cost center. These are displayed in the monitoring dashboard. With this feature we are adding an alarm threshold that creates an incident record.

## Why is this important?
SPA provides cost controls at account level (with budget alarms) and the organisation level (with monthly cost reports). However, we are missing a control at cost center level. The new capability is closing this gap.

## How to implement it?
PA already computes costs per cost center as a daily metric in CloudWatch. We will add a CloudWatch alarm to this metric, based on a configuration parameter in the settings file. In addition, we also need to detect CloudWatch alarms and create incident records in Incident Manager on alarm.
