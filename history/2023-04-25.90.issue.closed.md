# [\#90 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/90) `closed`: prevent login with root account

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-04-25 09:00](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/90):

## What is this?
These are mechanisms aiming to prevent damage from usage of root credentials and of IAM user credentials. On root authentication, a SCP will block permissions of the person. In addition, a management exception is triggered and appears in Incident Manager. On IAM user authentication, a management exception is triggered and appears in Incident Manager.

## Why is this important?
The normal usage of SPA is that end users connect over IAM Identity Center (ex-SSO). Root account credentials should not be used by SPA users. Attempts to authenticate as IAM root user may be malicious and go against corporate security policies. Similarly, authentication with IAM User credentials should be banned in SSO context.

## How to implement it?
There are no IAM policies for root IAM accounts. However, permissions given to a root IAM account can be limited with proper SCP policy ([Reference information](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/iam-access-denied-root-user))

- [x] change SCP provided with SPA to limit the permissions of an authenticated root IAM user
- [x] deploy in production
- [x] test the effectiveness of the new settings
- [x] ensure that regular SSO sessions are not impacted
- [x] add a feature file to describe detection and handling of root authentications
- [x] extend CDK code to deploy resources
- [x] add a lambda function 'OnConsoleLogin' to detect such events and to create an incident record
- [x] add related fixtures and tests
