Private hosted zone are really expensive, and should be managed as shared deployments.

Hello,
I don't have the feeling private hosted zone are expensive :
ref [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/?nc1=h_ls)
## Zones :
$0.50 per hosted zone / month for the first 25 hosted zones
$0.10 per hosted zone / month for additional hosted zones
## Queries (STD) :
$0.40 per million queries – first 1 Billion queries / month
$0.20 per million queries – over 1 Billion queries / month

Furthermore private hosted zone are a mandatory element for a lot of tests/behaviors based on internal naming of computer ; for example in Microsoft domains environments
