#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-05-19 17:32](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/103):

## What is this?
With this capability, SPA is able to change alternate contact information to the accounts that it manages. Alternate contact information can be defined at OU level. This is usually well adapted to the way AWS accounts are grouped together in an AWS Organization. Alternate contact can also be defined at account level, if needed.

## Why is this important?
In large organisations, AWS accounts share similar attributes such as tags and contact information. These attributes can change because of organizational changes of the enterprise itself. For example, a phone number is modified, or a new email has to used for hundreds of AWS accounts in the same OU. When updated information is reflected into SPA settings files, then it can be applied to AWS accounts automatically on next maintenance cycle. This is by far more efficient than manual operations in the console, or than a separate custom software development.

## How to implement it?

- [ ] add a new feature file for account information management
- [ ] add a new workbook to document account information management steps
- [ ] create new sample settings file in `fixtures/settings/settings-with-contact-information.yaml`
- [ ] add a test scenario in `tests/test_cdk_configuration.py` to fail on new sample settings file
- [ ] add code to `cdk/configuration.py` to accept new keywords and to update OU and account configurations
- [ ] pass `make all-tests`
- [ ] pass `make lint`
- [ ] deploy in production
- [ ] use the system to change contact information of a test account in production
- [ ] use the system to change contact information of a test OU, and of all accounts that it contains, in production
