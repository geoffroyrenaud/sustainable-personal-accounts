# [\#73 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/73) `closed`: generalize default settings

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-02-18 20:49](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/73):

## What it this ?
We introduce a single section of the settings file to capture all `default` settings that apply at account level. This is a change from previous situation where the `default` keyword could be used jointly within the `accounts` section and also in the `organizational_units` section.

## Why is this important?
This change streamlines the configuration of SPA with a single place to set default settings. Previously you could have to replciate default settings at two different places of the configuration file.

## How to implement it?
- [x] change configuration scenarios in feature files
- [x] change `fixtures/settings/settings.yaml` accordingly
- [x] change `tests/test_configuration.py` accordingly
- [x] introduce a new section `default` in `resources/configuration.py`
- [x] eliminate usage of the sub-section `default` in the section `organizational_units` in `resources/configuration.py`
- [x] ensure that all sub-sections of the section `organizational_units` have a name that are prefixed with `ou-`
- [x] eliminate usage of the sub-section `default` in the section `accounts` in `resources/configuration.py`
- [x] ensure that all sub-sections of the section `accounts` have a name that are 12-digits
- [x] deploy in production
