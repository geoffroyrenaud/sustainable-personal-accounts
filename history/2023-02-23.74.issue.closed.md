# [\#74 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/74) `closed`: add a new Lambda function to reset all accounts

## What is this?
This Lambda function will scan organizational units and managed accounts, and tag accounts with state 'vanilla'.

## Why is it important?
The state machine is based on some tag structure. When code or settings break these tag structure, then state machines do not work anymore. Since the state of an account is contained in a tag attached to it, for such situations you can use AWS Organizations to change the state of any account. For this you would visit the page of each account and then change the tag `account-state` to the value `vanilla`. This operation is feasible for some dozens of accounts, but can become tedious for large number of accounts. Therefore the need to reset accounts to the state `vanilla` with a simple invocation of a Lambda function devoted to this usage.

## How to implement it?
- [x] document recovery scenarios in a feature file
- [x] create a new Lambda function `ResetAccounts` 
- [x] add a workbook to help system administrators
- [x] test in production environment

This feature has been tested after transition from ':' to '-' in tag names. For example 'account:holder' became 'account-holder'. Because of this change, all accounts had to be re-tagged. This was done with the new reset command, that forces a re-tag and then a preparation for each account. Worked very well in production with 50+ accounts
