# [\#100 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/100) `closed`: compute monthly cost reports for any currency

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-05-11 21:04](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/100):

## What is this?
This delivers extra Excel monthly reports for non-USD currencies. For the currencies that have been configured, SPA fetches conversion rates from a public API and one Excel file is created per currency. The extra reports are send over email, along the reports in USD.

## Why is this important?
This capability is important to show back and to charge back the cloud costs in local currency

## How to implement it?

- [x] expand the feature file on cost management
- [x] add a new attribute `features_with_cost_extra_currencies` to `cdk/configuration.py`
- [x] test default value and actual configuration from settings file
- [x] add sample value `['EUR']` for attribute  `features_with_cost_extra_currencies` in `fixtures/settings/settings.yaml`
- [x] add code to `lambdas/on_cost_computation_handler.py` to fetch rates from `https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD`
- [x] test code that fetches rates over the Internet
- [x] add code to `lambdas/on_cost_computation_handler.py` to build extra reports for configured currencies
- [x] add code to `lambdas/costs.py` to pass currency and rate to the function that builds Excel report
- [x] pass `make all-tests`
- [x] pass `make lint`
- [x] push to production
- [x] test the generation of reports with multiple currencies and their transmission over email
- [x] reflect the handling of currencies in cost management workbook

Software behave as expected in production. Additional summary reports are added for each currency that has been configured in SPA settings.
