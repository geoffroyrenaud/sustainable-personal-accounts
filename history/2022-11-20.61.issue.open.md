## What is this?
Purpose of this enhancement is to remove dependency pymsteams

## Why is it important?
We try to keep SPA as slim as possible, and to support native web requests instead of loading external modules.

## How can it be implemented?
[ ] write a function to post a notification (title and subject) to Microsoft Teams
[ ] change code to use this function instead of pymsteams 
[ ] remove dependency in setup.py

Reference code exist to submit notification to an incoming webhook of Teams:
