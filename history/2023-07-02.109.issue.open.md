#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-07-02 07:18](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/109):

## What is this?
With this feature, the creation and the closing of accounts becomes activities that are recorded by SPA

## Why is this important?
While SPA itself does not create nor suspend AWS accounts, it does interact with the life cycle of AWS accounts. Activity files, in CSV format, are for data engineers and service managers who need details about each account. Noting the creation and suspension of AWS accounts complete the picture provided in activity files.

## How to implement it?
A CloudTrail event `CloseAccount` is generated by `organizations.amazonaws.com` when an account is closed. The subject account is mentioned in dictionary `requestParameters` on key `accountId`.
