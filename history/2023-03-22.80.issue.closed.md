## What is this?
Currently, lambda permissions are defined centrally and passed to each lambda function. This is creating repeated code that could be centralised.

## How to implement it?
- [x] add to `cdk/serverless_stack.py` some code to assign permissions on every functions
- [x] remove permission assignments of lambda function from every other `.py` in `cdk`
- [x] pass `make lint`
- [x] pass `make all-tests`
