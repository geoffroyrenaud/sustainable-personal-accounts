# [\#23 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/23) `closed`: select best platform for codebuild project (x86 versus ARM, size)

Currently Codebuild projects are deployed on ARM small. However, the Codebuild free tier provides 100 minutes every months on x86 small environment. If this is proving better value for money, code should be adjusted to better align with the Codebuild free tier. Also, buildspec templates should be adjusted accordingly. For example, different release of AWS_Nuke has to be considered.
