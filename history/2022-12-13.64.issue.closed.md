## What is this?
This is an adaptation of SPA where configuration file accepts settings per individual accounts.

## Why is it important?
Today SPA settings is structured per organizational unit. This is great for collections of accounts that are similar. However, for production accounts or for atypical accounts, there is a need for individual settings. A typical use case is for production accounts, where you want to adjust budget thresholds to individual accounts.

## How to implement it?

- [x] add a feature file `features/account_management.feature` to document settings file and configuration options
- [x] introduce new key `accounts:` in SPA settings file
- [x] save account settings under individual parameter name that reflects account identifier
- [x] add a python module `code/settings.py` to fetch settings for a given account, that looks OU settings if needed
