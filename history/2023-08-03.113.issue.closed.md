# [\#113 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/113) `closed`: record identity of last console login

## What is this?
Identity of the principal who accesses an account is now recorded on console login

## Why is this important?
Previously we only recorded the date of console login. However, when multiple principals can access an AWS account, it is important to trace who exactly accessed an account for the last time.

## How to implement it?
- [x] update `lambdas/on_account_event_handlr.py` to record the logging identity in shadow
- [x] add a test in `tests/test_lambda_on_account_event_handler.py`
- [x] pass `make all-tests`
- [x] pass `make lint`
- [x] deploy in production
- [x] check shadow record after successful login

now that we successfully record identity on console login, it could be nice to reflect this information in periodic inventories of accounts
