# [\#81 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/81) `closed`: automate metering and reporting of costs per cost center

## What is this?
This create a new CloudWatch metric to monitor actual costs per cost center, on a daily basis. This metric reflect actual costs in the visual dashboard. It is also used to report on unblended costs per cost center every month, as a multiple CSV and Excel files.

## Why is this important?
We want to be able to monitor operating costs in CloudWatch dashboard. Cost Explorer can do that easily, but we need a distribution of costs per cost center (and not per account nor per service). We need a visual indicator in the monitoring dashboard, and we also need CSV and Excel files for formal FinOps reviews and for show back activities.

## How to implement it?
- [x] complement architectural diagram
- [x] describe scenarios in feature file
- [x] add a new lambda that query Cost Explorer once per day, get data for each account, and publish metrics per cost center
- [x] expand the cockpit to reflect daily costs in the monitoring dashboard
- [x] add a new lambda function that query Cost Explorer once per month, get data for each account, and produces a CSV report
- [x] also produce Excel reports 
- [x] add to Excel reports outlines per OU
- [x] pass `make lint`
- [x] pass `make all-tests`
- [x] deploy in production
- [x] inspect reporting on next month

the summary report per cost center computed by SPA matches the monthly report produced per AWS with service breakdown or with linked account breakdown - in other terms: it works!

the idea of the breakdown per OU is to classify different kinds of cost, e.g, production versus non-production, teams of personal accounts, etc.
