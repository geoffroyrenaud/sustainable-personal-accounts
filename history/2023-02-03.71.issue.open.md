## What is this?
This is a workbook for enterprises that have thousands of AWS accounts to manage.

## Why it is important?
SPA by itself does not create nor terminate accounts. When a new consultant joins Reply, we use Control Tower to create an account from the Account Factory (implemented with Service Catalog). This works well with the current rate of staff arrival, but of course it will not sustain a high-rate of people on-boarding,  and is prone to configuration errors.

Therefore the need to provide, aside SPA itself, workbooks and code that control the creation and termination of thousands of AWS accounts. Current thinking is limit code dept by leveraging existing solution.

## How to implement it?
* [ ] Create a new workbook in Markdown `.md` in the `workbooks` directory
