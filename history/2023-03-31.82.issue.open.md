## What is this?
This is providing direct access to the CloudWatch dashboard created by SPA to the DevOps engineer, directly from the Identity Center (ex-SSO) portal page.

## Why is this important?
Since SPA is deployed on one specific account, the monitoring dashboard is sitting there. Therefore, to access the dashboard you have to switch to the SPA account, and then go to the CloudWatch console, and then click on the dashboard. Direct access to the dashboard eliminates repetitive navigation steps and streamline the experience of CloudOps.

## How to implement it?
- [ ] read and use [Share your Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards with anyone using AWS Single Sign-On](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/share-your-amazon-cloudwatch-dashboards-with-anyone-using-aws-single-sign-on/)
- [ ] deploy in production with the CloudOps of Reply
- [ ] add a workbook to contextualise guidelines in the context of SPA
