#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-03-16 07:57](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/76):

## What is this?
With this feature, SPA gets from the Cost Explorer API a report for a given account and attaches it to an ongoing incident record

## Why is this important?
When an incident record is created on budget alert, there is a need to provide contextual information to responders. This is eliminating manual checks that are performed during resolution.

## How to implement it?
- [x] when an account id is provided in an exception, get cost report from the cost explorer api and add it to the incident record
- [x] develop a lambda function url to fetch the report over public Internet
- [x] when an account id is provided in an exception, get account information and tag the incident report
- [x] add an architectural diagram made with draw.io
- [x] complement feature file related to exceptions
- [x] add account id to the budget exception
