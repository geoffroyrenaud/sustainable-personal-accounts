When accounts are moved between OU , this cause a drift status in the CT dashboard, and the account isn't governed anymore. You need to reregister the OU afterward.
PB : 
- Only one registration seems to be able to occur at a time, and it can take a fair amount of time (~ 40 min for 6 accounts)
- Sometimes enrollment fail. Each time it happened it was due to CT SNS queue which can't be reused and need to be manually deleted prior to enrollment (need to assume CTExecution Role in the account else it's blocked by SCPs)

AWS (Efoe) suggest to move accounts by modifying provisioned products in service catalog instead of doing it from aws organizations.

Actually, after experimentations from the CLI, I could not find a way to gather automatically data required to change a provisioned product in service catalog. For example, I could not find a way to retrieve first and last name of some SSO identity from `aws identitystore` commands.

As a result, there is a need to find alternate solution to implement the state machine than OU

actually, we implemented a state machine based on account tagging - this is a different approach than the initial thinking - see #14
