# [\#91 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/91) `closed`: prevent resource sharing outside the organization

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-04-25 09:21](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/91):

## What is this?
This is a preventive control that forbid the creation of a shared resource outside the organization

## Why is this important?
Without guardrail, a malicious person could create a resource in a personal account and share it with another account outside the organization. By closing the gap with an additional guardrail, we prevent risks related to data leakage and to misusage of corporate asset.

## How to implement it?
AWS is providing a suitable example of a policy [Preventing external sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples_ram.html)

- [x] rename sample SCP provided with SPA `fixtures/policies/deny_creation_of_costly_resources.json` to `fixtures/policies/preventive_controls_for_sandboxes.json`
- [x] add a statement to prevent resource sharing outside the organization
- [x] deploy in production
- [x] test deny on RAM resource created with public access
- [x] ensure that regular users are not impacted by this change
- [x] update the related workbook to explain how to change the behaviour where needed
