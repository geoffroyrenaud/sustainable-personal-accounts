**Labels**: `bug`

## What is this?
Currently SPA produces monthly reports on the first day of the month at 4:42am. However we observe some glitches with reports provided by Cost Explorer some days later. After troubleshooting, we determined that not all costs are available at 4:42am.

## Why is this important?
We need accurate cost reports!

## How to implement it?
- [x] move the production of reports from 4:42am to 12:42pm
- [x] check report accuracy on following month
- [x] move the production of reports to 2nd day of the month
- [x] check report accuracy on following month
- [x] move the production of reports to 3rd  day of the month
- [x] move the production of reports to 6th day of the month
- [x] add another production of reports on 14th day of the month
- [x] update workbook related to account cost management
- [x] check report accuracy on next month -- cross fingers!

Based on information captured from public Internet, the schedule for reports has been moved to 2nd day of the month. This gives AWS a bit more than 24 hours to populate the invoice.

After control of monthly reports provided in production, it appears that AWS may still add costs to the invoice after 2nd day of the month. We will delay again, by 24 hours more hours, the creation of monthly reports and check on next month if this is delivering accurate results.

Here is information received from AWS on their invoicing cycle:
- 3rd of the month: AWS Usage Invoice
- 5th of the month: AWS Support Invoice
- between the 7th and the 10th of the month: AWS Credit Memo Invoices
- 13th of the month: Consolidated Summary (Invoicing and Request for Payment)

Therefore, SPA should compute monthly reports in two waves:
- on 6th of the month to reflect usage and support costs
- on 14th of the month to reflect final elements of the AWS billing console and of the AWS cost explorer console

Summary reports produced on June-14th reflect Cost Explorer information on June-16th. The accuracy is there and this ticket is closed.
