#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-08-16 15:56](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/116):

## What is this?
This is a JSON file that you can use to create a SCP in your AWS Organization. This policy denies actions when authenticated as root account. This was already available in suggested SCP for sandbox accounts. With this addition, the same protection can be extended to non-sandbox accounts

## Why is this important?
In a modern AWS Organization, based on Single Sign-On, the usage of root accounts is a back door that should be controlled carefully. Actually, the need for root account authentication is limited to specific use cases. Most of the time, you want to ensure that root account authentication is neutralized.

## How to implement it?
- [x] provide a sample JSON file in the `fixtures/policies/`directory
