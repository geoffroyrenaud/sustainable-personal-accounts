## What is this?
This is a new `make history` command that fetches all issues from GitHub and transform them to Markdown files that can be integrated into git commits.

## Why is this important?
Meta-information attached to the code is really important. It explains architectural decisions and provides facts on past development. By automating the reflection of project progresses, we allow contributors to learn and to improve.

## How to implement it?
This is leveraging the excellent [gh2md](https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md) package from Matt Duck.

Definition of Done:
- [ ] add `gh2md` to `requirements.txt`
- [ ] add command `make history` to Makefile
- [ ] add workbook `workbooks/manage-project-contributions.md`
- [ ] commit first version of the history
