#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-06-16 20:28](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/106):

## What is this?
When SPA computes monthly cost reports for previous month, it also computes forecast reports for on-going month. These reports give early indication on important changes before being hit by invoices at the end of months.

## Why is this important?
Because costs follow levels of consumption, they can vary a lot from one month to the next one. Therefore the need for an early indicator, produced around the middle of the month, that can help to detect and fix abnormal conditions.

## How to implement it?
Since final cost reports for previous month are produced on the 14th, there is plenty of data for forecast expense as well

- [ ] add code to create cost forecasts for on-going month
