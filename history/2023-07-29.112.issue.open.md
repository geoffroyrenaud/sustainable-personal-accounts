## What is this?
SPA now comes with new policies adapted to the recent changes of AWS on permissions that are related to cost management.

## Why is this important?
AWS has introduced granular permissions for access to Cost Explorer reports. It is important to reflect this change into SPA.

## How to implement it?
AWS has document the change in a blog post [Changes to AWS Billing, Cost Management, and Account Consoles Permissions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/changes-to-aws-billing-cost-management-and-account-consoles-permissions/)

Action plan:
- [x] change `fixtures/policies/allow_account_automation.json`
- [x] deploy in production
- [ ] ensure that cost reports are produced as usual
