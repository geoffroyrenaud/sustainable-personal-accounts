## What is this about?
This is an extension of the setup workbook to forward console login events captured by the management account of the organization.

## Why is this important?
The default behaviour of SPA is to add a forwarding rule related to console logins in each account that it manages. However, when cloudtrails are managed globally, these events are emitted in region where IAM Identity Center has been deployed of the management account of the Organization. Therefore the need to add a forwarding rule there.

## How to implement it?

- [x] enhance setup workbook to deploy this forwarding rule
