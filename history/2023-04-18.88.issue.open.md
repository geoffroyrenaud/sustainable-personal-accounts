### What is this?
I want to add the capacity to SPA to give temporary credential for sandbox user in order to use automation in CI/CD like Github actions or Gitlab CI

### Why is this important?
It is important to easily manage temporary admin credential in CI/CD to avoid credential spreading and to be as near as possible as production best practices

### How to implement it?
Create a lambda function to receive a JWT, this lambda should : 
- validate the JWT (based on a well known JWS (RFC https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7800.html ?). We need to be able to use it online but also offline (ex for non publicly exposed CI/CD) 
- use the email to select the correct target AWS account inside Organization
- return a temporary "admin" creds (AccessKey, SecretKey, SessionToken) in a json format in order to be used by the CI/CD
Store the JKS for offline purpose in AWS SSM
