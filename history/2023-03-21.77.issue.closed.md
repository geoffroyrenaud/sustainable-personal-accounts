# [\#77 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/77) `closed`: restructure code with simple naming conventions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-03-21 11:02](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/77):

## What is this?
With this ticket we rename directories that contain CDK code and Lambda code. We also rename files in the `test` directory to reflect the location of target python module.

## Why is this important?
The structure of the code base is not simple for newcomers to the project. Currently the directory `resources` contains code for CDK, and the directory `code` contains code for the Lambda functions. Names of test modules do not reflect if tested modules are in `resources` or in `code`. We want to streamline the experience of software engineers coming to SPA so as to accelerate their on-boarding.

## How to implement it?
- [x] rename the directory `code` to `lambdas`
- [x] rename the directory `resources` to `cdk`
- [x] fix all tests in the command `make all-tests`
- [x] review the README and other Markdown files to reflect the updated code structure
- [x] rename files in the directory `test` to reflect the origin of tested modules, e.g., `test_lambda_events.py`
- [x] add lambda function `CheckHealth` to validate the state of the run-time
- [x] fix run-time errors
