**Labels**: `good first issue`

## What is this?
Here we fine-tune the EventBridge rules to prevent useless invocations

## Why is this important?
Since Lambda invocations increase linearly with the number of accounts that SPA manages, it is important to maintain these invocations to a very minimum.

## How to implement it?

- [ ] only use events that begin or end transactions to trigger the metering Lambda - other events are useless
- [ ] only use expiration events from DynamoDB to trigger transaction time outs - other DynamoDB events are useless
