# [\#99 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/99) `closed`: facilitate the on-boarding of many existing accounts after initial setup

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-05-09 13:12](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/99):

## What is this?
With this feature you can on-board existing accounts easily. After the deployment of SPA you can trigger a Lambda function that will look for managed accounts and that will set each of them in VANILLA state.

## Why is this important?
Some customers deploy SPA for aligning existing accounts to the best tagging practices brought by SPA. But they have to on-board each account manually, by adding tag ' account-state` to value `vanilla`. This cumbersome process can now be replaced with the manual launch on one Lambda function to do the job.

## How to implement it?

- [x] Add an optional step to the setup worbook to trigger `ResetAccounts` Lambda function and onboard existing accounts
- [x] Change workbook related to account state management to document the use case of the `ResetAccounts` Lambda function
