## What is this?
This is a new version of the [Full setup of SPA workbook](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/blob/main/workbooks/full-setup-of-spa.md)

## Why is this important?
New features of SPA such as the usage of SSM Incidents Manager require specific one-off activations. There is a need to review the setup workbook to these enhanced capabilities.

## How to implement it?

- [x] mention the need for 'cdk bootstrap'
- [x] document the manual activation of  SSM incidents Manager for the automation account
- [x] review the permissions needed by SPA for access to the AWS Organization
