# [\#75 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/75) `open`: automate the approval of terms of service

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-03-16 07:43](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/75):

## What is this?
When an account is assigned to a person, we want to share terms of service for the corporate resource that is provided.

## Why is this important?
There is a need to align the management of personal AWS accounts with the management of other corporate resources such as computers or smart phones. 

## How to implement it?
- [ ] add an architectural diagram in draw.io
- [x] add a feature file to describe the scenarios related to the approbation of terms of service
- [x] add a fixture file to be used as default terms of service template
- [x] add a workbook to explain the experience of the system manager
- [ ] add `cdk/documents.py` to handle templates with frontmatter
- [ ] add `tests/test_cdk_documents.py` using `fixtures/documents/terms-of-use.md`
- [ ] pass `make all-tests`
- [ ] pass `make lint`
- [ ] add configuration parameters to integrate external message files into `fixtures/settings/settings-with-notifications.yaml`
- [ ] add loading settings test to `tests/test_cdk_configuration.py`
- [ ] edit `cdk/parameters_construct.py` to load notifications in SSM parameter store
- [ ] add integration test to `tests/test_cdk_parameters_construct.py` with mocked SSM
- [ ] pass `make all-tests`
- [ ] pass `make lint`
- [ ] add `cdk/on_notification_construct.py` to build DynamoDB table and related Lambdas functions
- [ ] add `tests/test_cdk_on_notification_construct.py` to ensure data encryption in DynamoDB
- [ ] edit `cdk/serverless_stack.py` to integrate new construct
- [ ] add notifications to `tests/fixture_small_setup.py`
- [ ] add function `get_notification_for_account` to `lambdas/settings.py` 
- [ ] add related integration test to `tests/test_lambda_settings.py``
- [ ] pass `make all-tests`
- [ ] pass `make lint`
- [ ] introduce module `lambdas/on_notification_handler.py` to handle events related to notifications
- [ ] add a Lambda that can be invoked over the web to confirm explicit approbation by the end user
- [ ] add `tests/test_lambda_on_integration_handler.py` for integration tests
- [ ] pass `make all-tests`
- [ ] pass `make lint`
- [ ] deploy in production
- [ ] validate notifications sent on next maintenance window
- [ ] confirm notifications in production
- [ ] inspect DynamoDB table on notifications
- [ ] inspect DynamoDB table on activities
- [ ] inspect monthly notifications report

As per feature file, we anticipate that a number of validations can be submitted to end users over time. The general architectural approach is that this will be powered by named documents. In addition, documents will be made out of Markdown with a YAML header (aka, frontmatter approach). The Markdown can easily be converted to HTML into mail messages sent to end users. The YAML header supports structured and meta-information, e.g., message title, document validity period, etc. During the deployment of the solution with CDK, each document is loaded and turned into one parameter in SSM. Documents are then exposed to Lambda functions via a new python module dedicated to documents, aka, `lambdas/documents.py`

issue has been heavily reworked to better plan foreseen work on the topic
