# [\#67 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/67) `closed`: add a Lambda function to release all accounts

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2022-12-17 21:11](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/67):

## What is this?
This Lambda function will scan organizational units and managed accounts, and tag accounts with state 'released'.

## Why is it important?
During normal operations the accounts are transitioned automatically from the state `released` to the states `expired`, `assigned`, `prepared` and `released` again. However, in a case of a bug into one of the processing Lambda functions, it may happen that the cycles break and that accounts stay in an intermediate state without additional processing.
Since the state of an account is contained in a tag attached to it, for such situations you can use AWS Organizations to change the state of any account. For this you would visit the page of each account and then change the tag `account:state` to the value `released`. This operation is feasible for some dozens of accounts, but can become tedious for large number of accounts. Therefore the need to reset accounts to the state `released` with a simple invocation of a Lambda function devoted to this usage.

## How to implement it?
- [x] document recovery scenarios in a feature file
- [x] create a new Lambda function `ReleaseAccounts` 
- [x] add a workbook to help system administrators

With this code SPA has a simple mechanism to recover from broken state machines. The solution is suitable for hundreds of AWS accounts.
