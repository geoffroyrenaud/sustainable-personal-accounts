# [\#63 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/63) `closed`: Change the tagging prefix used by SPA in settings

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2022-11-22 14:48](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/63):

### What is this?
Today SPA tags accounts with names such as `account-owner` and `account-state`. However, large corporations may want to use a different prefix.

### Why is this important?
Purpose of this change is to align SPA with corporate tagging policies defined for cloud resources.

### How to implement this feature?
* [x] Define a new parameter for settings file
* [x] Use the parameter for the creation of event rules
* [x] Pass the parameter to Lambda functions with a new environment variable
* [x] Leverage the environment variable within tagging code
