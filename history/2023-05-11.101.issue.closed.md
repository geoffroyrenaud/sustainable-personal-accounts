## What is this?
This takes into account the tags set to accounts that are not in scope of SPA management, but that are listed in cost reports.

## Why is this important?
Before the change, all accounts that are not in scope of SPA management (via some OU or directly) appear in cost center 'NoCostTag'. After the change, the value of the tag `cost-center` is used.

## How to implement it?

- [x] add a function `enumerate_all_accounts()` in `lambdas/account.py`
- [x] use this function in `lambdas/on_cost_computation_handler.py` in replacement of the enumeration from `lambdas/settings.py`
- [x] pass `make all-tests`
- [x] pass `make lint`
- [x] push to production
- [x] produce reports and validate the cost center of accounts that are not in scope of SPA

This has been validated in production. Note that new code also applies to the computation of daily cost metrics.
