# [\#83 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/83) `closed`: send monthly cost reports over email

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-04-02 21:55](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/83):

## What is this?
With this feature you can define in settings how SPA should send monthly cost reports over email. After deployment of new settings, each recipient will receive in mailbox a set of Excel files on first day of the month, to report on costs of previous month.

## Why is it important?
While SPA produces cost reports on a S3 bucket, this is not a convenient interface for most accounting teams and FinOps teams. By pushing these files directly into the mailboxes of selected recipients, we automate the distribution of management files end-to-end.

## How to implement it?
- [x] add feature scenarios to configure the system
- [x] complement architectural diagrams to mention the usage of ses
- [x] add feature scenarios to describe the distribution of reports over email
- [x] develop a new module `lambdas\email.py` to prepare ses messages and to manage mime multipart messages
- [x] support the transformation of messages from markdown to html
- [x] test this module with moto
- [x] add settings to mention an originating email address
- [x] add settings to list recipients of cost reports
- [x] add setting to mention message template in markdown
- [x] deploy in production
- [x] create a workbook to explain configuration steps
- [x] create ses address in sandbox
- [x] test the sending of cost reports in ses sandbox
- [x] move ses to production mode
- [x] control reception of cost reports on next month

Monthly reports have been correctly distributed over email to multiple recipients. The GitOps automation chain is working as expected.
