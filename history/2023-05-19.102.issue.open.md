# [\#102 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/102) `open`: add support level to inventories of accounts

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-05-19 17:14](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/102):

## What is this?
This is an optional feature where SPA adds a column to the periodic inventories of accounts, with the level of support provided by AWS.

## Why is this important?
Since each AWS account can have its own level of support, some companies can adjust costs of AWS support to the business importance of each account, and of cloud resources that it supports. However, this needs periodic reviews to prevent discrepancies.

## How to implement it?
There is no API to get level of support of an AWS account, however this can be derived from the list of severity levels made available to one specific account. The idea has been documented in a blog post related to [support plans for AWS partners](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/aws-partners-determine-aws-support-plans-in-organization/), yet it is applicable to any AWS customer. By using the boto3 describe_severity_levels() function, we can determine current support plan for one account.
