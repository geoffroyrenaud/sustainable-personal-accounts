#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2022-12-21 09:02](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/69):

## What is this?
With ChatOps we can bring progressive and explainable automation to the operation of SPA. A use case is when a billing alert has been hit, to send a message over chat to someone and to validate that an action has been taken. Another use case is the conditional deletion of cloud resources, validated by the resource owner.

## Why is it important?
SPA has been introduced to reduce as much as possible the administration burden of many AWS accounts. In order to scale, there is a need for SPA to interact directly with the owners of AWS accounts for simple and repetitive tasks.

## How to implement this?

- [x] consolidate reference information from other public projects:
    - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/easily-set-up-interactive-messages-for-your-amazon-connect-chatbot/
    - https://dropbox.tech/security/meet-securitybot-open-sourcing-automated-security-at-scale
    - https://aws.amazon.com/chatbot/faqs/
    - https://github.com/aws-samples/multi-environment-chatops-bot-for-controltower

- [x] produce reference architecture for integrating social media with event-driven architecture
- [x] write feature file for notifications to Microsoft Teams
- [x] write feature file for integration with Slack
 
Other tickets will be created for the progressive development of ChatOps capabilities:
- [x] transmit notifications from SPA to Microsoft Teams -- feature existed previously, this is an updated architecture and setup
- [ ]Â transmit notifications from SPA to Slack
- [ ] accept, execute and respond to commands received from Slack
- [ ] accept, execute and respond to commands received from Microsoft Teams
- [ ] interact with individual persons over Slack
