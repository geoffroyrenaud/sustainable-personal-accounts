# [\#58 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/58) `closed`: Send alerts and notifications to Microsoft Teams

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2022-11-16 08:43](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/58):

## What is this?
This optional feature is aiming to close the feedback loop via social channels. When a billing alert is raised, or when a CodeBuild projects fails for some reason, the information is pushed to a channel with multiple eyes.

## Why is it important?
Currently SPA distributes alerts and notifications over e-mail. While mailing lists can be helpful, they have proven less reactive than social exposure. For example, if a team member goes beyond his budget, he can neglect proper handling of the billing alert in his inbox. But if the same alert is exposed on a social channel, then the person will receive encouragements from the entire team to fix the issue.

## How is this implemented?
- [x] add pymsteams package as a project dependence
- [x] accept webhook parameter in settings file
- [x] pass webhook to Lambda functions as an environment variable
- [x] expand OnAlert Lambda function to push messages to webhooks
- [x] add a workbook to explain how to setup a Microsoft teams webhook and how to use it in SPA

Hello,

One small feedback from delivered projects :

A lot of companies refuse teams and in general they adopt slack ; should have an option to publish to slack OR teams ðŸ˜‰

hello Bertrand, yes you are right, Slack is a popular chat solution in the enterprise. For the time being, my immediate need is on Microsoft Teams so this feature development is on it. Of course, anyone is entitled to add Slack support separately. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

With 88d4d5fb444188a6fc8a14b7a2046072e01aae2a the packaging of lambda code has been extended for external dependencies like pymsteams

Several weeks after deployment of the solution, the Reply team has successfully generated multiple alerts that have been published in our internal Microsoft Teams channels. This is working great!
