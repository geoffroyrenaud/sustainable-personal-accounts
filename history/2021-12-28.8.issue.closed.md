# [\#8 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/8) `closed`: Create a role in Management account that can be assumed from within Automation account

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2021-12-28 15:57](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/8):

Our first requirement is to limit blast radius of any action engaged in the context of the Management account of the AWS Organization. For that, we will run code either in the context of the Automation account, or in the context of individual personal accounts. Since code ran in Automation has to move accounts around, there is a need to grant specific permissions via a role and a trusted relationship managed in IAM.

Here is how the sequence of actions is looking like for moving an account from one OU to another one:
- code is logged in in the context of the Automation account - this one is in OU Sandbox
- code assumes role ServiceRoleForAutomation in the Management account
- this role is passing permissions to manage accounts in OU Sandbox and in children OU of Sandbox via a customized policy SandboxPowerAccess
- code can run boto3 code to move accounts around, to act on accounts, to create IAM resources within accounts, to create Codebuild projects within accounts, all within the context of the OU Sandbox and children OU

Policy SandboxPowerAccess is defined using multiple identifiers:
- `organization_identifier` - something like `o-a1b2c3d4e5`
- `root_ou_identifier` - something like `r-f6g7h8i9j0example`
- `sandbox_ou_identifier` - a string starting with `ou-`
- `vanilla_accounts_ou_identifier` - a string starting with `ou-`
- `assigned_accounts_ou_identifier` - a string starting with `ou-`
- `released_accounts_ou_identifier` - a string starting with `ou-`
- `expired_accounts_ou_identifier` - a string starting with `ou-`
- `management_account` 
- `automation_account`
- `test_account` - account used for tests

With that in mind, you can create the policy SandboxPowerAccess by substituting values in following template:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "organizations:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:organizations::{management_account}:account/{organization_identifier}/*",
                "arn:aws:organizations::{management_account}:ou/{organization_identifier}/{vanilla_accounts_ou_identifier}",
                "arn:aws:organizations::{management_account}:ou/{organization_identifier}/{assigned_accounts_ou_identifier}",
                "arn:aws:organizations::{management_account}:ou/{organization_identifier}/{released_accounts_ou_identifier}",
                "arn:aws:organizations::{management_account}:ou/{organization_identifier}/{expired_accounts_ou_identifier}"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "account:*",
                "codebuild:*",
                "iam:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Epic:

- [x] Authenticate in root account and take note of identifiers listed above

- [x] Go to IAM console and create policy SandboxPowerAccess, based on previous template

- [x] Create role ServiceRoleForAutomation and attach policy SandboxPowerAccess to it. Add trusted relationship with account Automation.

- [x] Authenticate to account Automation and add an IAM policy AssumeServiceRoleForAutomation, that allows to assume role ServiceRoleForAutomation in account Management

- [x] To test the overall setup, there is a need to create an EC2 instance in the context of Automation, to connect to it, to assume role ServiceRoleForAutomation in Management account, and to pass commands to move accounts in AWS CLI

ARN of the role to assume within EC2 or Lambda code is arn:aws:iam::396045030202:role/ServiceRoleForAutomation

In order to restrict the scope of IAM permissions set in SandboxPowerAccess, resources could be limited to the management of policies and of roles. 

- [ ] limit resources that can be targeted via IAM in SandboxPowerAccess policy

completed as per #13  - would deserve a complete workbook for manual setup
