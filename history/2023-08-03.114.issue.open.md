# [\#114 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/114) `open`: use account tag for budget alerts instead of account email

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-08-03 16:40](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/114):

## What is this?
When an account is tagged with key `account-holder`, use the value of this tag as target email for budget alerts. Previously, SPA always used the account e-mail for budget alerts.

## Why is this important?
While we commonly put personal e-mail addresses on personal AWS accounts, we also throw away AWS accounts when people leave the company. Some enterprises prefer to recycle AWS accounts over time, meaning that the same accounts may be assigned to several persons, one after the other. In such situations, it is easier to change an account tag that an account email.

## How to implement it?
- [ ] add test to `tests/test_lambda_worker.py`
- [ ] consider tag `account-holder` rather than account email in function `get_preparation_variables()` in `lambdas/worker.py` 
- [ ] pass `make all-tests`
- [ ]Â pass `make lint`
- [ ] deploy in production
- [ ] change tag `account-holder` on an account used for tests
- [ ] change tag `account-state` to `assigned` to trigger preparation with Codebuild
- [ ] validate that the environment variable `BUDGET_EMAIL` passed to Codebuild reflects the new value of the tag `account-holder`
