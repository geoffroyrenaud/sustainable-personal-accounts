# [\#111 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/111) `closed`: set time range of cloudwatch dashboard to multiple weeks

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-07-18 06:57](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/111):

## What is this?
The monitoring dashboard displays a time range of 4 weeks. Previously it was displaying the default range of 3 hours.

## Why is this important?
SPA is operating over days and weeks. This is not aligned with the default settings use by CloudWatch. Therefore, new users can be confused when looking at the monitoring cockpit for the first time. Seasoned admins of SPA always start monitoring activities by changing the time range of the dashboard, which is a friction point in the interface.

## How to implement it?
SPA should set a relative start of the time range for all widgets while building the dashboard.

Reference:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_cloudwatch/Dashboard.html

Activities:
- [x] change `cdk/cockpit_construct.py`
- [x] deploy in production
- [x] validate the default range displayed by the cockpit

so happy to not change the default range manually on every access of the dashboard cockpit :-)
