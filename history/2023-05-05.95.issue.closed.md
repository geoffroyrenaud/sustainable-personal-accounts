# [\#95 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/95) `closed`: add metrics for all dynamodb tables

## What is this?
Currently the monitoring dashboard provides metrics for one DynamoDB table. However, SPA features several tables so it is important to include related metrics into the dashboard.

## Why is this important?
We want the monitoring dashboard to cover all cloud resources handled in SPA. If there is a performance issue, or some error in DynamoDB, then these should appear on the monitoring dashboard

## How to implement it?
The metric names provided by CDK constructs for DynamoDB tables collide, so it is not possible to use the straightforward approach that works for Lambda functions.

The monitoring dashboard in production now reflects metrics for all dynamodb tables in the AWS account
