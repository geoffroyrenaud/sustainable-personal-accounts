## What is this?
This change allows for the manual computation of cost reports in the past, even on accounts that do not exist in the organization anymore. Previously, reporting could only be done on accounts that do exist in the organization at reporting time.

## Why is this important?
While SPA computes the cost reports automatically on each month, it may be important, on some important code changes, to re-compute past cost reports. In such situations, SPA may have to handle account identifiers that do not exist anymore in the organization. So far this was raising exceptions and the software was unable to produce cost reports in the past for some months.

## How to implement it?
SPA should be ready to accept exceptions on `describe` operations related to AWS accounts.

We launch manually the creation of cost reports 4 months ago, and the software does not fail on accounts that existed at that time, but that have disappeared in the meantime. In summary cost reports, these accounts have no name, no organizational unit, and no tag. This is the expected behaviour in such situations
