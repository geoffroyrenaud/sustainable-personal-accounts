# [\#92 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/92) `closed`: limit the AWS regions available to sandbox accounts

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-04-25 13:59](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/92):

## What is this?
This is a preventive control that limits the creation of cloud resources to an explicit list of enabled regions.

## Why is this important?
For performance reasons, the purge script is limited to selected AWS regions. Therefore the risk that some cloud resources are deployed in some regions and not nuked afterwards.

## How is this implemented?
A condition on `aws:RequestedRegion` can be used, as [explained by AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_aws_deny-requested-region.html)

- [x] list services with a single endpoint, e.g., us-east-1 for IAM, that should be included in the condition
- [x] add a statement to sample SCP that prevents actions outside selected regions
- [x] deploy in production
- [x] ensure that you cannot start a CloudShell session in an non-permitted region, but that you can start one in an authorized region
- [x] update the related workbook to explain how to change the behaviour where needed

Global services do not support Regions. The following services each have a single global endpoint:
- Amazon CloudFront
- AWS Global Accelerator
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- AWS Network Manager
- AWS Organizations
- Amazon Route 53
- AWS Shield Advanced
- AWS WAF Classic

Reference information: [Global endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#global-endpoints)

Global services with single endpoints are provided from following AWS regions:

- Amazon CloudFront - `us-east-1` - ref https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cf_region.html
- AWS Global Accelerator - `us-west-2` - ref https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/global_accelerator.html
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) - used to be `use-east-1` - multiple endpoints nowadays
- AWS Network Manager - used to be single point - has multiple endpoints nowadays
- AWS Organizations - endpoints are available in multiple regions
- Amazon Route 53 - endpoints are available in multiple regions
- AWS Shield Advanced - endpoints are available in multiple regions
- AWS WAF Classic - `us-east-1` 

Therefore, at the of the day, following regions should be always enabled: `us-east-1`,  `us-west-2`
