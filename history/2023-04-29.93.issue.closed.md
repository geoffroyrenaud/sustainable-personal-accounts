# [\#93 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/93) `closed`: log signin from users

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-04-29 21:22](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/93):

## What is this?
When a user signs in to a personal account, this is mentioned in shadow records for the account.

## Why is this important?
The objective is to monitor the last access to a personal account, and to mention this in account inventories

## How to implement it?
The idea is to forward events from signin.amazonaws.com to the default bus of the account where SPA has been deployed, and to trigger a Lambda function that will update shadow records.

- [x] provide a CloudFormation template that deploy an eventbridge rule in management account of the organization
- [x] test the CloudFormation template in production
- [x] add a Lambda function `UpdateShadowOnSignin` to detect console login events and to update shadow records
- [x] add fixture templates of console login events for tests
- [x] add a test function to validate the Lambda function on signin event
- [x] update account inventories to mention date of last signin when available
- [x] add to preparation phase the forwarding of console login events to central bus 
- [x] pass "make all-tests"
- [x] pass "make lint"
- [x] deploy in production
- [x] pass one test account through maintenance transaction
- [x] validate that console logins do appear in the log of the Lambda function
- [x] validate that console logins do appear in the shadow records for related accounts
- [x] validate that console logins are counted in the monitoring of transactions
- [x] pass all accounts through maintenance transaction (to create the forwarding of console login events everywhere) 
- [x] validate that console logins do appear in the log of the Lambda function
- [x] validate that console logins do appear in the shadow records for related accounts
- [x] validate that console logins are listed in CSV reports of activities, along other transactions
- [x] validate that console logins are counted in the monitoring of transactions
- [x] add feature file related to the management of console login events

I think we can not only get the last date but use each login to put metric in a cloudwatch graph to have a better understanding of usage of accounts. We will be able to exploit it later like having count per hour, count per day or per month per user.

hello Geoffroy, thanks for jumping in. Metrics are a good idea indeed. Would you agree that a breakdown per cost center would be useful?

After some days in production, the software behaves as expected. The metric in the dashboard reflects the count of daily logins on personal accounts. In addition, logins with IAM users appear both in metrics and in the Incident Manager.
