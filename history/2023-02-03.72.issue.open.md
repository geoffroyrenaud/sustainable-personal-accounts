## What is this?
This is a new CLI command added to the SPA project to estimate the cost of SPA deployment. When you type the command `make cost-estimation` this generates a CloudFormation template and passes it to the AWS CLI command `estimate-template-cost`. The output is a link to the AWS Calculator with cost indication for resources in the template.

## Why is this important?
While SPA is based on serverless AWS products and services, and very cost-effective, we need to factually estimate costs that it can incur.

## Hot to implement it?
* [ ] Add to `Makefile` a new target `cost-estimation` with appropriate shell commands
