# [\#70 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/70) `closed`: add an event store to persist events

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-02-03 09:48](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/70):

## What is this?
This is a new persistence layer for events related to SPA. We would like to persists all events captured from the bus into a store and we want to stream these changes to publishers. In addition, we will also correlate events participating to the same transaction. Initially we have two kinds of transaction:
- the release of a new account: vanilla --> preparation --> release
- the maintenance of an account: expiration --> purge --> preparation --> release

## Why is it important?
The introduction of an event store into SPA is serving multiple goals:
- Aggregate events per accounts to identify complete and partial maintenance cycles -- from technical view to business view
- Provide a clear representation of each account state and history of most recent maintenance window -- functional observability
- Generate new events on completed maintenance cycles -- to meter SPA as a service on the long run

## How to implement it?
The following is the recommended list of activities as per Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD):
* [x] Add a new `features/metering.feature` file to describe expected behaviour of the event store
* [x] Add to `fixtures/settings/setting.yaml` a parameter related to events TTL in days
* [x] Ensure that `make all-tests` fails
* [x] Change `resources/configuration.py` to accept configurable TTL for events in days
* [x] Add unit tests in `tests/test_configuration.py` to validate TTL configuration input
* [x] Ensure that `make all-tests` passes
* [x] Create a new `resources/metering_construct.py` with a construct `Metering` and an empty `__init__()` function
* [x] Include this new construct into `resources/serverless_stack.py` and ensure that `make all-tests` passes correctly
* [x] Add code to `resources/metering_construct.py` that creates a DynamoDB table to persist events for configurable TTL
* [x] Copy `code/on_events_handler.py` to `code/on_events_then_store_handler.py`
* [x] Copy `tests/test_on_events_handler.py` to `tests/test_on_events_then_store_handler.py`
* [x] Ensure that `make all-tests` passes
* [x] Edit `tests/test_on_events_handler.py` to create a lits of events for a given account and to pass it to the handler
* [x] Edit  Lambda code in `code/on_events_then_store_handler.py` to save events to the DynamoDB table
* [x] Ensure that `make all-tests` passes

the code has been pushed to production

After 2 weeks in production we can safely close this issue.
