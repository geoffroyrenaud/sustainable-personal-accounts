## What is this?
We add titles and messages to exceptions detected on time-out.

## Why is this important?
Before that change, exceptions triggered on time-out create incident records with no title nor textual message.

## How to implement it?

- [x] add a test to ensure that events generated on time-out do have a title and some message
- [x] pass `make all-tests`
- [x] pass `make lint`
