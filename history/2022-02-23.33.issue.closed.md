# [\#33 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/33) `closed`: add constructor to Worker

Currently, Worker only has class methods. Most methods rely on a `session` parameter. Because of this, there is heavy cascading of session transmission across methods. To fix this, we suggest that instances of Worker are created to encapsulate session as instance attribute.

The need for the injection of session context has been reduced with the generalization of the moto library. As a consequence, we drop this issue for the time being.
