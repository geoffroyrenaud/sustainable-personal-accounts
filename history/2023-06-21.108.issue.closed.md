#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-06-21 06:19](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/108):

## What is this?
Update CSV reports for ongoing month every week instead of every day

## Why is this important?
Reporting induces reads from DynamoDB. With this change we reduce costs from DynamoDB, while still providing some visibility on ongoing activities.

## How to implement it?

- [x] change event rule that triggers reporting on ongoing activities
