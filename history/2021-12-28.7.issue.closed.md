# [\#7 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/7) `closed`: Add CodeBuild projects to prepare personal accounts

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2021-12-28 15:08](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/7):

With this issue we introduce a CodeBuild project to prepare each assigned account.

Pre-conditions:
- Issue #6  has been completed

Epic:

- [ ] Add a file `templates/prepare_account_buildspec.yaml` that will use AWS CLI to put an event `PreparedAccount`. This template should use placeholder `{account_identifier}` that will be replaced in python with the id of the actual account that is handled by some CodeBuild project.

- [ ] Modify code of Lambda function `SignalAssignedAccount` in `/code/signal_assigned_account_lambda.py`. Suppress code that is putting event `PreparedAccount`. Instead, add boto3 code to create a CodeBuild project using `templates/prepare_account_buildspec.yaml` transformed with the account id that is passed to the Lambda function. Code should also start the execution of the Codebuild project.

- [ ] Run `deploy_resources.py` again to update lambda function, then test the deployment by moving one AWS account to the OU Assigned Accounts. Ensure that execution of  Lambda function `SignalAssignedAccount`, of Codebuild project `PrepareAccount` and of Lambda function `MoveAssignedAccount` are reported in CloudWatch logs, and that the account is moved automatically to the OU Released Accounts. Then delete the CodeBuild project that was created by boto3 code.

- [ ] Modify again the code of Lambda function `SignalAssignedAccount` in `/code/signal_assigned_account_lambda.py`. This time, you will have to add code that 1) assumes role ServiceRoleForAutomation in Management account, 2) create CodeBuild project in target account using `templates/prepare_account_buildspec.yaml` transformed with the account id that is passed to the Lambda function. Code should also start the execution of the Codebuild project.

- [ ] Run `deploy_resources.py` again to update lambda function, then test the deployment by moving one AWS account to the OU Assigned Accounts. Ensure that execution of  Lambda function `SignalAssignedAccount`, of Codebuild project `PrepareAccount` and of Lambda function `MoveAssignedAccount` are reported in CloudWatch logs, and that the account is moved automatically to the OU Released Accounts.

codebuild projects and buildspec templates have been fully integrated as per commit #38f72edd5dc48c2af2b71236da69f5d5e9b2e48e
