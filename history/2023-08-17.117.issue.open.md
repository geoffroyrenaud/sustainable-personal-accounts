# [\#117 Issue](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/117) `open`: continuous deployment for SPA

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-08-17 07:13](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/117):

## What is this?
This automates the update of SPA when either the code base is updated or when there is a configuration change.

## Why is this important?
We want to update SPA automatically. Instead of running 'make deploy' manually, let do that in Codebuild instead. In addition, we need to clearly separate the management of code (that is public) and the management of settings (that is private). We will leverage AWS IAM for managing access to settings and for permissions to act on SPA environment

## How to implement it?
The target architecture is distributed as the following:
- SPA code is from its own git repository - a public repository at GitHub
- settings file are from a private git repository - for example, a dedicated CodeCommit repository
- Codebuild will clone and combine these two set of files - need permission to access private CodeCommit
- Codebuild will run commands from Makefile to deploy or update a SPA environment - need permission to act on SPA account

Definition of Done:
- [x] add fixture `fixtures/buildspec/update_spa_environment.yaml`
- [ ] add workbook `workbooks/setup-continuous-deployment.md`
- [ ] add diagram `media/continuous-deployment.drawio`
- [ ] add feature `features/continuous-deployment.feature`
- [ ] deploy in production, with CodeCommit for SPA private settings
- [ ] validate environment update when main branch of SPA repository is updated
- [ ] validate environment update when settings are modified
