#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235078?v=4" width="50">[bernard357](https://github.com/bernard357) opened issue at [2023-04-19 13:34](https://github.com/reply-fr/sustainable-personal-accounts/issues/89):

## What is this?
With this feature we introduce an additional level of breakdown for charges. The objective is to get visibility on charges at AWS account level, in order to support motivated conversations with AWS.

## Why is it important?
Currently SPA consolidates charges per cost center and per OU, so as to align financial breakdown with internal organization. However, AWS has always a per-account view of commercial agreements, credits, refunds, etc. Therefore the need to reflect accounts into the charges reports.

## How to implement it?

- [x] introduce a third-level of breakdown in monthly charge reports, with an additional column for account ids
